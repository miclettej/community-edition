An OCI Registry is required to host the package images. All packages maintained within the Taznu Community Edition source repository will utilize the VMware Harbor instance located at `projects.registry.vmware.com`. Third party packages are free to use their own registries.

Examples are:

* Harbor
* GCR
* DockerHub
* Amazon ECR
