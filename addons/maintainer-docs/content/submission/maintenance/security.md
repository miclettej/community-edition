title: Security & CVE
---

Security concerns and CVE's can occur within a package in 2 different manners. The first is in the underlying, packaged software. The other is in the package itself.

If a concern is present in the underlying software, the Maintainer is expected to update the package with patched or updated versions of the effected software when available. The Maintainer is not expected to patch the underlying software.

If the concern is in the package itself, the Maintainer is expected to provide a patch as soon as possible. For example, if an overlay introduces a vulnerability, it is expected that the Maintainer fix the overlay to remedy the concern.
