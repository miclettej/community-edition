Retirement is when an Owner declares that the package will no longer be maintained or its use/functionality is obsolete or deprecated. In these cases, the package will remain in the Tanzu Community Edition package repository for XXX PERIOD OF TIME until it is removed.

During this time, other interested parties are able to assume ownership of the package to prevent retirement.

Should retirement be announced for a package, other interested parties are welcome to take ownership and continue maintenance duties.
