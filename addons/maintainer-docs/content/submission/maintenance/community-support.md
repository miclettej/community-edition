title: Community Support
---

Community support is expected of Owners and Maintainers. Owners and Maintainers should routinely attend Community Meetings and Office Hours for the underlying software within their package. They should also attend Tanzu Community Edition public meetings to keep abreast on the ongoings of TCE.

Owners should provide a means for the Community to interact with them and the Maintainers. This interaction can be for providing feedback and asking general usage questions. This could mean a Slack channel, discussion board or other public forum. Maintainers shall monitor and respond in a timely fashion.

There should also be a public board for the Community to provide bug reports, feature requests and other enhancements. This could be provided by the source repository, such as with GitHub, or another tool like Bugzilla.
